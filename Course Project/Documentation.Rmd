#Background:    

This shiny web application predicts iris species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on user query inputs of the lengths and widths of iris flower's sepal and petal.    
The model uses the rpart method on a training dataset comprised of 70% of the iris data in the R package.   

#How to use the App.    

In the User Input panel, enter the numbers for the lengths and widths (centimeters) of iris flower's sepal and petal. 
Then hit the Submit button to get the predicted species for your query inputs.

Example:

* Example 3: Sepal Length = 5.0, Sepal Width = 3.3, Petal Length = 1.4, Petal Width = 0.2
